    <h1>"NASA's Mars Rover Missions: Exploring the Red Planet"</h1>
    <p>NASA's Mars rover missions represent some of the most ambitious and groundbreaking endeavors in space exploration. Since the first successful landing of a rover on Mars in 1997, NASA has continuously advanced its technology and scientific objectives to explore the Red Planet's surface, geology, and potential for past or present life.The journey began with the Sojourner rover, which was part of the Mars Pathfinder mission. Sojourner's successful landing and operations provided invaluable data about Martian soil and rocks, setting the stage for future missions. Building on this success, NASA launched the Spirit and Opportunity rovers in 2003. These twin rovers, part of the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) mission, far exceeded their expected mission durations, providing key insights into Mars' geology and evidence of past water activity.</p>
